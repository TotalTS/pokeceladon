# Pokémon Celadon Version

This hack tries to be a little upgrade from Red/Blue/Green without being too ambitious. Mostly the whole game has graphic updates and some new events.
Started this project a long time ago and some ideas changed, but I'm commited to finish it now: https://web.archive.org/web/20180903101807/https://hax.iimarckus.org/topic/7257/

Why Celadon Version?:
Celadon City is my favorite city in Gen 1, this is a very personal hack.

To patch the ROM, Beat Patcher is recommended. https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/893/

Features:

- New sprites.
- New party menu icons ported from Gen 2.
- New palettes.
- New Super Gameboy border.
- You can press SELECT to switch Pokémon in your party menu.
- You can press B to run or swim faster in water.
- You can talk to use SURF, CUT, STRENGTH.
- You can have all starters like in Pokémon Yellow.
- Lapras and Pikachu have unique sprites for SURF.
- If you have badge(s) Guards have shorter texts on Route 23.
- Nurse at Silph Co. 9F still heals you after beating Giovanni.
- Mew under the truck.
- New trainer classes Rookie and Yurijou. (From prototypes)
- You can battle Yurijou before Brock at Route 22 Gate 2F. He will give you TM19 to make the battle easier if you have a Charmander as starter.
- You can make Erik and Sarah meet again at Safari Zone. Doing so will unlock free pass to it.
- New Celadon University location, where you can get a Magikarp with Dragon Rage and a Celadon University Diploma.
- You can have a Rocket Suit after beating the Nugget Bridge. (Optional) Use it to skip battles against the Team Rocket.
- With Rocket Suit, you can catch enemy's Pokémon. (But it ends the battle instantly)

Post game events:

- If you have all 151 Pokémon catched, you will battle with Professor Oak at the Pokémon League.
- S.S. Anne returns with new trainers.
- At Celadon Hotel, you can select a new home in any city you want.
- Rematch the Gym Leaders as much as you want. (Giovanni is replaced by Yurijou)
